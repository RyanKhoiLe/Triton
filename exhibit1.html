        <li>Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos.</li>
        <li>Flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war.</li>
        <li>The newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre.</li>
        <li>The light bulb in the painting represents the sun. Also "bombilla" (lightbulb in Spanish) sounds similar to "bomba" (bomb in Spanish)</li>
        <li>The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors</li>

    <h2> History of Guernica </h2>
      <p>From wikipedia: The bombing of <strong>Guernica</strong> (26 April 1937) was an aerial attack on the Basque town of Guernica during the <b>Spanish Civil War.</b>
      It was carried out at the behest of the <b>Spanish nationalist government (Victor Franco)</b> by its allies, the <b>German (Hitler)/b> air force's Condor Legion and the <b>Italian (Mussolini)</b>
      Aviazione Legionaria, under the code name <b>Operation Rügen</b> (Rügen means "to reprimand" in German).
      All the roads and bridges were <b>destroyed</b> so the citiens could not escape. After the bombing, the survivors were mowed down with <b>machine guns.</b> </p>
